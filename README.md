# ELEC 4840 – AI for Medical Images (Assignment 2)

This repository contains two deep learning projects completed for **ELEC 4840: AI for Medical Images** at HKUST.  
Both tasks apply computer vision and deep learning techniques to real-world medical imaging problems.

## Projects Overview

| Problem | Title | Summary |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Q1 | [Retinal Image Grading using CLIP](./Q1_CLIP_retinal) | Used pretrained CLIP model to classify diabetic retinopathy severity via prompt-based zero-shot learning |
| Q2 | [Spleen CT Segmentation using 3D U-Net](./Q2_spleen_segmentation) | Applied a 3D U-Net model to segment spleen regions from `.nii.gz` CT volumes |

## My Focus Areas

-  OCR in retinal imaging using **CLIP + prompt engineering**
-  3D semantic segmentation with **Dice + CE hybrid loss**
-  Extensive **performance analysis**: AUROC, Dice, Jaccard, 95HD, Specificity, NPV
-  Hands-on with **PyTorch**, **TensorBoard**, **Colab**, and **medical image visualization (ITK-SNAP)**

---

## Technologies Used

- PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib
- CLIP model (ViT-B/32), U-Net (3D)
- TensorBoard for training logs
- `.nii.gz` medical imaging format (ITK-SNAP for visualization)
